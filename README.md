[**https://ai-mag.github.io**](https://ai-mag.github.io)

**AI-mag** is a **MATLAB** toolbox (using also COMSOL and Python) for **power electronic inductor optimization**. 
The goal of this tool is to **combine** the **accuracy of the Finite Element Method (FEM)** with the **evaluation speed** of **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**.

More precisely, the following **workflow** is implemented:
* Simulating many designs with **FEM thermal and magnetic** simulations (COMSOL)
* Extracting the important figures of merit out of the FEM simulations
* Extracting the same figures of merit with a simplified analytical model (for comparison)
* **Training regression ANNs** to reproduce the figures of merit (MATLAB or Python Keras and TensorFlow)
* Using the **ANNs**, **quickly** generate **accurate inductor designs** (without solving any FEM model)
* **Multi-objective** data exploration with a **GUI**

The following performances are achieved:
* The **average error** between the FEM simulations and the ANN predictions is **below 1%** 
* The **worst-case error** between the FEM simulations and the ANN predictions is **below 3%** 
* The tool is able **generate 300'000 designs per second** on a laptop computer
* The tool is able for compute **50'000 operating points per second** on a laptop computer

## Tutorial

This [short tutorial](TUTORIAL.md) explains how to install the tool, design inductors, and obtain Pareto fronts.

If you don't have MATLAB, you can quickly test the code on [Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com/capsule/5365652/tree).
Due to the limitations of Code Ocean, you can not use plots, GUI, or COMSOL.

## Scientific Paper

A **scientific paper** has been published in the **IEEE Open Journal of Power Electronics** about this tool. The paper describes the method used in the tool and presents some results (ANN trainings and inductor optimization). The paper is available as open-acces:
* [PDF version](PAPER.pdf)
* [DOI link](https://doi.org/10.1109/OJPEL.2020.3012777)

## Inductor Optimization Capabilities

Currently the following inductors are optimized:
* E-core inductor with an air-gap (with fringing field)
* Ferrite core (with loss map, DC bias, and IGSE)
* Litz wire winding (no packing model, with proximity losses)
* Forced convection cooling
* Sinus or PWM excitation (with DC bias)
* Coupled thermal/loss models

However, this toolbox is made in order to be **easily extended** with other inductors types, magnetic components (e.g., transformers, chokes), or optimization method (e.g., genetic algoritm).

## Compatibility

The tool is tested with the following MATLAB setup:
* Tested with MATLAB R2018a, R2018b and 2019a
* Deep Learning Toolbox ("neural_network_toolbox")
* Global Optimization Toolbox ("gads_toolbox")
* Optimization Toolbox ("optimization_toolbox")
* Signal Processing Toolbox ("signal_toolbox")

The tool is tested with the following COMSOL setup (for FEM simulations):
* COMSOL Multiphysics 5.4 or 5.5
* AC/DC Module (for the magnetic simulation)
* Heat Transfer Module (for the thermal simulation)
* CAD Import Module (for 3d geometry manipulation)
* MATLAB Livelink (for communication with MATLAB)

It should be noted that COMSOL is only required to run the FEM simulations, not for the ANN/regression or the inductor design evaluation.
In other word, COMSOL is required to generate the ANN training set, but not for running the design tool.

The tool is tested with the following Python setup (for ANN with Keras and TensorFlow):
* Python 3.6.8
* Numpy 1.18.1
* TensorFlow 2.1.0

However, the toolbox can work without Python, as long as the Python ANN engine is not used.

The tool is known to run with the following operating systems:
* Linux Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS
* Linux CentOS 7.5
* Microsoft Windows 10

The following softwares were used to generate resources but are not required to run the code:
* Adobe Illustrator 2020 - generating the GUI artwork
* Wolfram Mathematica 12 - generating analytical expressions
* PyCharm Community Edition 2019 - running and debugging the Python code

## FAQ

Do I need Python?
* Only if the Keras/TensorFlow ANN engine is used.
* Python is not required if the MATLAB ANN engine is used.

Do I need COMSOL?
* Only for generating the training/testing datasets for the ANN.
* Only for computing inductor design with FEM (without ANN).
* COMSOL is not required for designing inductors with ANN

Can this toolbox handle big data?
* Depending what is big data, few 10 millions of designs are definitely OK.
* The memory management model (everything is stored in RAM) does not allow billions of samples.

How fast is the code, do I need a powerful machine?
* The computation of the inductors is fully parallelized and/or vectorized.
* The code can compute tens of thousands inuductor design per second.
* The training of the ANN takes some minutes.
* The generation of the FEM training/testing sets takes some tens of hours.
* The following mid-range laptop is used: Intel Core i7-8650U @ 1.90GHz / 16GB RAM

I have a powerful cluster, can I use it?
* Yes, the code can run in parallel (multithreaded and/or completely distributed).
* The code has been run succesfully on a HPC cluster (with a LSF batching system). 

Can this code run with GNU Octave?
* The code is not compatible with GNU Octave.
* The ANN library is not compatible with GNU Octave.
* The COMSOL MATLAB Livelink is not compatible with GNU Octave.
* The GUI is not compatible with GNU Octave.

Why the tool in MATLAB and Python and not only in Python?
* Mainly due to the COMSOL MATLAB Livelink which is great.
* The MATLAB ANN engine is also simpler for beginners (compared to Keras/TensorFlow).
* Due to legacy code on MATLAB (some inductor models).

Can I use another FEM solver (e.g., Ansys, OpenFOAM, Fenics)?
* The tool has been written in order to minimize the dependencies to COMSOL
* Therefore, it would be easy to use another FEM solver.
